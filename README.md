MATLAB code used for simulations and model fitting in the paper "When one race is not enough: a relay model explains multisensory response times". 

Empirical data used for fitting can be found in the EmpiricalData folder.

Numbered scripts should be ran in order for any updates (as some scripts rely on fitted parameters from preceding ones). All functions used can be found in the Functions folder.
